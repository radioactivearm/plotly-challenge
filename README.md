# Functionality of App
With this app you can select from a dropdown menu any of many patients in a clinical study having to do with belly button bacteria. When they are selected the graphs on the page will update to show data related to them.
## The graphs
* Bar Graph - This graph shows the top ten Bacteria
* Bubble Plot - This is a nice vizualisation amount all of the bacteria found in the belly button 
* Demographics Info - This is a panel that has the metadata on the patent like gender and age
* Gauge - This shows how often the patient washs their belly button
